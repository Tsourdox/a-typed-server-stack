# a-typed-server-stack

This is a boilerplate of a node-express server that runs entirely on typescript without ever neeeding to compiling to JS.

Compatible with debugger in VS-Code!

### Installation
Just clone repo and run `npm i` once to install dependecies.

### Development
Run `npm start` or `npm run dev` (they are the same command) or start via debugger in VS Code, keep in mind that running the debugger will be slower than the script alone.

### Production
Simply run `npm run prod` which is going to run the server code with ts-node in production mode.

### Testing
Not implement - a feature for the future maybe ^^

**Enjoy!** üê•
